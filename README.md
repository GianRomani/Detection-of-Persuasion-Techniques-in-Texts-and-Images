# Detection-of-Persuasion-Techniques-in-Texts-and-Images

Project developed with two collegues for the Deep Learning course (Winter 2021). The goal was to deal with the three tasks described in [SemEval 2021 task 6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09284.pdf).

We implemented some of the methods that scored as the best for the competition and we added some new features, ideas or models that should improve the performances on the tasks (for the exam our code was supposed to run on Colab, so we had limitations on the dimension of the models and on the methods we could use) . 

A more detailed explaination on what we have done is in the Jupyter notebook.
